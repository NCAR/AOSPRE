#  Each line of the scanning table has two floating point numbers,
#  rotation and tilt, read according to Fortran list-directed
#  formatted I/O.
#
#  lines consisting of only <sweep> or  </sweep> mark the beginnings
#  and ends of what will be considered a "sweep"
#
#  Blank lines are ignored
#  Anything after a "#" on a line is ignored.
#

#  rotation:
#      Angle (degrees) between the radar beam and the vertical axis of the platform.
#      Zero is along the vertical axis; positive clockwise looking forward from
#      behind the platform.

#  tilt:
#      Angle (degrees) between the radar beam and a line perpendicular to the 
#      longitudinal axis of the platform, positive toward the front of the platform.

#  Rotation   Tilt
